- **Consistency Validation**: Cross-validation between related storage fields
- **Security Auditing**: Security scanning of all stored data
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic data recovery and cleanup for corrupted storage
- **Atomical Operations**: Safe data saving with rollback capabilities

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery
- **User-friendly Messages**: Improved error messages with severity indicators and recovery suggestions
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry logic for transient validation failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Safe fallbacks when validation fails
- **Progressive Warnings**: Contextual warnings that don't block user flow unnecessarily

## Technical Implementation Details

### InputValidator Enhancements
```typescript
// New validation options
interface DateValidationOptions {
  allowFuture?: boolean;
  minAge?: number;
  maxAge?: number;
  allowLeapYear?: boolean;
  allowTimezone?: boolean;
  requirePrecision?: boolean;
  allowWeekends?: boolean;
}

// Enhanced age calculation
calculatePreciseAge(birthDate: Date): {
  years: number;
  months: number;
  days: number;
  totalDays: number;
  isLeapYear: boolean;
}
```

### SecurityAuditor Enhancements
```typescript
// Advanced threat detection
detectAdvancedThreats(input: string): SecurityAuditResult;
enhancedSanitize(input: string): { sanitized: string; warnings: string[] };
validateRealTimeInput(input: string, type: string): ValidationResult;
```

### New Validation Features
- **Validation Caching**: Performance optimization through intelligent caching
- **Batch Validation**: Efficient validation of multiple inputs
- **Storage Consistency**: Cross-field validation for data integrity
- **Timezone Support**: Comprehensive timezone and DST handling

## Security Improvements

### Threat Detection Patterns Added
1. **Prototype Pollution**: `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`
2. **NoSQL Injection**: `$where`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$regex`
3. **SSRF Attacks**: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `file://`, `ftp://`
4. **Credential Leakage**: API keys, secret keys, bearer tokens
5. **Advanced XSS**: Encoded variants, CSS expression, @import attacks

### Data Integrity Features
- Null byte detection
- Unicode normalization
- Buffer overflow prevention
- Circular reference detection
- JSON structure validation

## User Experience Improvements

### Enhanced Date Picker
- Real-time validation feedback
- Contextual warnings for edge cases
- Improved error messages with suggestions
- Automatic recovery options

### Smart Input Handling
- Progressive validation (doesn't block user immediately)
- Contextual warnings based on user's age and region
- Security sanitization without breaking user flow
- Intelligent defaults and fallbacks

## Performance Optimizations

### Validation Caching
- Intelligent caching of validation results
- Automatic cache cleanup and expiration
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Optimized Security Scanning
- Efficient pattern matching
- Lazy evaluation for expensive checks
- Batch processing for multiple validations

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Date Edge Cases**: Leap years, timezone boundaries, historical dates
- **Security Tests**: All major attack vectors and edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Validation speed benchmarks
- **Corruption Tests**: Data integrity and recovery scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end validation workflows

### Development Tools
- Global test functions available in development mode
- Quick test commands for rapid validation
- Performance monitoring and alerts
- Security audit reporting

## Migration & Backwards Compatibility

### Safe Migration
- Graceful handling of existing invalid data
- Automatic cleanup of corrupted storage
- Progressive enhancement without breaking existing functionality
- Clear user communication about data issues

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Safe defaults when validation fails
- Recovery suggestions for invalid data
- Non-breaking warnings for edge cases
- Gradual enforcement of new validation rules

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and security
2. **Fail Secure**: Safe defaults when validation fails
3. **User-Centric**: Clear messages and recovery options
4. **Performance Aware**: Efficient validation without blocking UI
5. **Maintainable**: Well-structured, testable code
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add new validation rules and patterns

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Monitoring
